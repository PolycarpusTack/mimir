## Usage Examples

### Basic CLI Usage
```bash
# Analyze recent articles
python ai_scraper_integration.py recent

# Analyze by source
python ai_scraper_integration.py source "TechCrunch" --limit 50

# Start service for high-volume
python ai_scraper_integration.py service --workers 4
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from ai_analysis import AIAnalysisEngine

engine = AIAnalysisEngine()
result = engine.analyze_article(article)

# Access all results
print(f"Language: {result['preprocessing']['language']}")
print(f"Entities: {result['entities']['entities']}")
print(f"Keywords: {result['keywords']['keywords']['ensemble'][:5]}")
print(f"Sentiment: {result['sentiment']['overall_sentiment']}")
print(f"Industry: {result['industry']['primary_industry']}")
print(f"Insights: {result['insights']['summary']}")
```

### Database Integration
Results are automatically stored in PostgreSQL's JSONB metadata column:
```json
{
  "ai_analysis": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "components": ["preprocess", "entities", "keywords", "sentiment", "industry"],
