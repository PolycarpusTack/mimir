# Mimir Technical Debt Assessment Report

**Generated**: 2024-01-19  
**Project**: Mimir B2B News Scraper  
**Assessment Level**: Comprehensive  
**Risk Level**: HIGH  

## Executive Summary

The Mimir project contains **87 identified technical debt items** across multiple categories, with **15 critical** and **23 high-priority** issues requiring immediate attention. The most pressing concerns are:

- **Security vulnerabilities** with hardcoded credentials and potential injection risks
- **Large, monolithic files** violating single responsibility principle  
- **Missing test coverage** in critical authentication and data handling paths
- **Configuration management** scattered across multiple files without validation
- **Performance bottlenecks** from blocking operations in async contexts

**Estimated Remediation Effort**: 12-16 weeks across 4 phases

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### ðŸ”¥ 1. Security Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)

#### Hardcoded Credentials
**Files**: `config.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, Kubernetes manifests
```json
// config.json - Line 15
"smtp_password": "your-app-password"

// Multiple K8s files
stringData:
  password: CHANGE_THIS_STRONG_PASSWORD
```
**Risk**: Credential exposure, unauthorized access  
**Fix**: Implement proper secrets management with HashiCorp Vault or K8s secrets

#### Potential SQL Injection
**Files**: 61 files with dynamic SQL patterns
```python
// Pattern found across multiple database modules
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {table} WHERE id = {user_input}")
```
**Risk**: Data breach, database compromise  
**Fix**: Audit all SQL operations, implement parameterized queries

#### Insecure API Configuration
**File**: `api/app.py`
```python
"cors_origins": ["*"]  # Allows all origins
"allowed_hosts": ["*"]  # No host validation
```
**Risk**: CORS attacks, unauthorized API access  
**Fix**: Configure proper CORS policies and host validation

### ðŸ”§ 2. Architecture Issues (HIGH)

#### Monolithic Files
- `analytics_manager.py`: 1,470 lines
- `async_scraper.py`: 950 lines  
- `technical_debt_scanner.py`: 941 lines
- `embedding_pipeline.py`: 816 lines

**Risk**: Poor maintainability, testing difficulty  
**Fix**: Refactor into smaller, focused modules following SRP

#### Tight Coupling
**Pattern**: Direct database imports throughout codebase
```python
// Found in 23+ files
from db_manager import DatabaseManager
db = DatabaseManager()  # Tight coupling
```
**Risk**: Difficult testing, poor scalability  
**Fix**: Implement dependency injection and repository pattern

### âš¡ 3. Performance Issues (HIGH)

#### Blocking Operations in Async Context
**Files**: `async_scraper.py`, `worker_manager.py`
```python
async def process_articles():
    time.sleep(DEFAULT_DELAY)  # Blocking in async!
```
**Risk**: Poor performance, resource waste  
**Fix**: Replace with `asyncio.sleep()`, audit all async functions
