# Playwright Integration - Phase 1.1 Complete âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Updated requirements.txt
Added:
- `playwright>=1.40.0` - Core browser automation library
- `playwright-stealth>=1.0.6` - Anti-detection measures

### 2. Created setup_playwright.py
A comprehensive setup script that:
- Checks Playwright installation
- Installs Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers
- Installs system dependencies (Linux)
- Creates `playwright_config.json` with safe defaults
- Updates `config.json` with feature flags
- Creates necessary directories
- Runs validation tests

### 3. Created Configuration Files

#### playwright_config.json (created by setup script)
- Browser settings (Chromium enabled by default)
- Timeouts and viewport configuration
- Stealth mode settings
- Resource blocking options (images, fonts, media)
- Screenshot settings for debugging

#### config.json additions:
```json
"playwright_scraping": {
    "enabled": false,  // Disabled by default for safety
    "config_file": "playwright_config.json",
    "fallback_to_beautifulsoup": true,
    "js_site_indicators": [...]
}
```

### 4. Created sites_to_scrape_playwright_example.json
Example configurations for:
- React news sites
- Vue.js news portals
- Angular dashboards
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   python setup_playwright.py
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   The setup script will automatically test the installation.

## Safety Features

1. **Feature Flag**: Playwright is disabled by default in config.json
2. **Fallback Mode**: Automatic fallback to BeautifulSoup if JS rendering fails
3. **Resource Limits**: Maximum concurrent contexts limited to 3
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even if Playwright fails

## Next Steps

Phase 1.2 will implement the PlaywrightScraper class with:
- Async/await pattern for efficiency
- Error handling and retry logic
- Integration with existing database
- Performance monitoring

## Configuration Example

To enable Playwright for a specific site, add to sites_to_scrape.json:
```json
{
    "name": "Modern News Site",
    "js_required": true,
    "playwright_settings": {
        "wait_for_selector": ".article-list",
        "wait_for_load_state": "networkidle"
    }
}
```

## Rollback Instructions

To completely disable Playwright:
1. Set `"enabled": false` in config.json under `playwright_scraping`
2. The system will automatically use BeautifulSoup for all sites
3. No code changes required
