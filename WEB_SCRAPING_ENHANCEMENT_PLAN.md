# Web Scraping Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines a foolproof, risk-mitigated implementation plan to enhance Mimir's web scraping capabilities with Playwright (JavaScript rendering), Scrapy framework migration, and proxy rotation support.

## Implementation Principles
1. **Zero Downtime**: All changes maintain backward compatibility
2. **Incremental Rollout**: Each phase is independently deployable
3. **Rollback Ready**: Every change includes rollback procedures
4. **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive tests before production
5. **Performance Monitored**: Metrics tracking at each stage

## PHASE 1: Playwright Integration (2 weeks)

### Goals
- Add JavaScript rendering capability without disrupting existing scrapers
- Support modern news sites (React/Vue/Angular)
- Maintain current performance levels

### Implementation Steps

#### 1.1 Environment Setup (Day 1-2)
```bash
# Tasks:
- Add playwright to requirements.txt
- Create setup_playwright.py for browser installation
- Add feature flag ENABLE_JS_SCRAPING to config.json
- Create playwright_config.json for browser settings
```

#### 1.2 PlaywrightScraper Class (Day 3-5)
```python
# playwright_scraper.py structure:
class PlaywrightScraper:
    - __init__(config, db_manager)
    - async scrape_with_js(url, selectors)
    - handle_authentication(credentials)
    - capture_screenshot(article_id)
    - cleanup_resources()
    - error_handling with fallback to BeautifulSoup
```

#### 1.3 Database Integration (Day 6-7)
```sql
-- Add to articles table:
ALTER TABLE articles ADD COLUMN rendering_method VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'html';
ALTER TABLE articles ADD COLUMN screenshot_path TEXT;
ALTER TABLE articles ADD COLUMN js_errors JSONB;
```

#### 1.4 Scraper.py Integration (Day 8-9)
```python
# Modify NewsScraper class:
- Add js_required field to sites_to_scrape.json
- Auto-detect JS sites (check for React/Vue markers)
- Conditional routing to PlaywrightScraper
- Fallback mechanism if JS rendering fails
```

#### 1.5 Testing Suite (Day 10-11)
```python
# test_playwright_integration.py:
- Test JS site scraping
- Test fallback mechanisms
- Performance benchmarks
- Resource cleanup verification
- Error handling scenarios
```

#### 1.6 Rollout Strategy (Day 12-14)
1. Deploy with feature flag disabled
2. Enable for single test site
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Gradual rollout to JS-heavy sites
5. Full production enablement

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# Instant rollback:
1. Set ENABLE_JS_SCRAPING = false in config.json
2. System automatically uses BeautifulSoup for all sites
3. No data loss or service interruption
```

## PHASE 2: Proxy Rotation Implementation (1 week)

### Goals
- Prevent IP-based blocking
- Support multi-tenant isolation
- Maintain scraping reliability

### Implementation Steps

#### 2.1 Proxy Manager Setup (Day 1-2)
```python
# proxy_manager.py:
class ProxyManager:
    - load_proxy_list()
    - validate_proxy_health()
    - rotate_proxy()
    - track_proxy_performance()
    - blacklist_failed_proxies()
```

#### 2.2 Integration Points (Day 3-4)
- Requests library proxy support
- Playwright proxy configuration
- Per-domain proxy assignment
- Tenant-specific proxy pools

#### 2.3 Monitoring & Alerts (Day 5-6)
- Proxy health dashboard
- Failure rate monitoring
- Automatic failover
- Cost tracking (for paid proxies)

#### 2.4 Testing & Rollout (Day 7)
- Load testing with proxies
- Geographic distribution tests
- Failure scenario testing

### Configuration
```json
{
  "proxy_settings": {
    "enabled": false,
    "rotation_strategy": "round_robin",
    "health_check_interval": 300,
    "failure_threshold": 3,
    "proxy_providers": [
      {
        "type": "static_list",
        "proxies": ["http://proxy1:8080", "http://proxy2:8080"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## PHASE 3: Scrapy Framework Migration (4 weeks)

### Goals
- Modernize scraping architecture
- Improve scalability and maintainability
- Leverage Scrapy's ecosystem

### Implementation Strategy

#### 3.1 Scrapy Wrapper Approach (Week 1)
```python
# scrapy_adapter.py:
class ScrapyAdapter:
    """Wraps Scrapy to maintain compatibility with existing code"""
    - run_spider(site_config)
    - convert_to_scrapy_items()
    - maintain_existing_database_interface()
```

#### 3.2 Spider Migration (Week 2-3)
1. Create base spider template
2. Migrate one simple RSS feed
3. Migrate one complex HTML scraper
4. Performance comparison tests
5. Gradual migration of remaining sources

#### 3.3 Feature Parity (Week 4)
- Custom middleware for rate limiting
- Error handling compatibility
- Database pipeline integration
- Monitoring integration

### Migration Path
```
Current: scraper.py → BeautifulSoup → Database
Phase 1: scraper.py → ScrapyAdapter → Scrapy → Database
Phase 2: Gradual spider migration
Phase 3: Full Scrapy with legacy adapter for old configs
```

## Risk Mitigation Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| JS rendering performance hit | High | Medium | Resource limits, selective enablement |
| Proxy detection/banning | Medium | High | Diverse proxy sources, rotation strategies |
| Scrapy migration bugs | Medium | High | Extensive testing, gradual rollout |
| Resource exhaustion | Low | High | Monitoring, auto-scaling, circuit breakers |

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Playwright)
- ✓ 90% success rate on JS sites
- ✓ <5 second render time per page
- ✓ Zero impact on existing scrapers

### Phase 2 (Proxies)
- ✓ 50% reduction in blocking incidents
- ✓ 99.9% proxy availability
- ✓ <100ms proxy switching time

### Phase 3 (Scrapy)
- ✓ 2x throughput improvement
- ✓ 50% code reduction
- ✓ 100% feature parity

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Universal Rollback
```bash
# Any phase can be rolled back instantly:
1. git checkout <previous-release-tag>
2. Set feature flags to disable new features
3. No database migrations to reverse (additive only)
4. Previous scrapers continue functioning
```

## Timeline Summary

- **Week 1-2**: Playwright Integration
- **Week 3**: Proxy Rotation
- **Week 4-7**: Scrapy Migration
- **Week 8**: Optimization & Documentation

Total: 8 weeks with buffer time included
