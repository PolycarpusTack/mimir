# CLAUDE.md - Ultimate AI Coding Guidelines for Claude Code (v5.0)

## üö® TOP 5 NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES - MUST READ FIRST

1. **NEVER REPLACE COMPLEX COMPONENTS WITH SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS** ‚Äî Always fix the actual problem in existing code, never create a "simplified" replacement.

2. **ALWAYS FIX ROOT CAUSES** ‚Äî Diagnose and address the underlying issue, don't create workarounds or patches that mask it.

3. **LLM-DIRECTIVE: WHEN REQUIREMENTS ARE AMBIGUOUS, ASK FOR CLARIFICATION** ‚Äî If any part of the request is unclear, always ask specific questions rather than making assumptions.

4. **CODE MUST EXACTLY MATCH REQUIREMENTS** ‚Äî Implement precisely what was requested, no extra features, no altered behavior unless explicitly approved.

5. **EVERY FUNCTION MUST HANDLE ERRORS AND EDGE CASES** ‚Äî No exceptions. All code must validate inputs, handle errors gracefully, and consider edge conditions.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember: When in doubt, ASK. It's always better to clarify requirements than to make incorrect assumptions.**

## 1. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### 1.1 Enterprise-Grade Mindset

**Default to enterprise-worthy solutions.** This means:

- Prioritize stability, robustness, security, and maintainability
- Comprehensive error handling is a core requirement, not optional
- Follow established software engineering best practices

### 1.2 Clarity and Simplicity

- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - prioritize the simplest solution that effectively solves the problem
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - eliminate redundant code through reusable abstractions
- **YAGNI**: You Ain't Gonna Need It - implement only what's explicitly requested
- **Readability**: Code should be written for humans to read and understand

### 1.3 Correctness

- **Accuracy**: Code must correctly implement requirements and produce expected output
- **Completeness**: Implement all specified requirements, no more and no less
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent behavior across similar operations
- **Security**: Follow secure coding practices, sanitize inputs, validate outputs

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If requirements are unclear or ambiguous, STOP and ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.**

### 1.4 Maintainability and Scalability

- **Modularity**: Break down complex systems into smaller, independent modules with clear interfaces
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between modules
- **High Cohesion**: Elements within a module should be closely related and focused on a single purpose
- **Extensibility**: Design code to allow for future enhancements with minimal effort
- **Testability**: Write code that's easy to test with small, focused functions and dependency injection

### 1.5 Efficiency Considerations

- **Profile Before Optimizing**: Only optimize after identifying performance bottlenecks
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms (consider Big O complexity)
- **Resource Management**: Ensure efficient use of resources (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O)
- **Balance**: Find the right balance between performance and maintainability

---

## 2. ROBUSTNESS & ERROR HANDLING

### 2.1 Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **LLM-DIRECTIVE: Error handling is not optional. Every function must have appropriate error handling.**

#### 2.1.1 Input Validation

- **ALWAYS validate all function inputs** at the start of each function
- Use strong typing and schema validation where possible
- Validate not just type but also value ranges, formats, and business rules
- Be explicit about required vs. optional parameters
- For REST APIs, validate query parameters, path parameters, headers, and body

#### 2.1.2 Error Handling Patterns

- **Use try/catch blocks** for operations that may fail
- Create specific error types/subclasses for different error categories
- Provide meaningful error messages that aid debugging
- Include context information in errors (parameters, state, operation)
- Handle errors at the appropriate level, don't just propagate all errors to the top level

#### 2.1.3 Graceful Degradation

- Design for partial system failure (some components may be down)
- Implement fallbacks and safe defaults when possible
- Include retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Log errors for monitoring but don't expose sensitive information to users
- Alert on critical errors but silence or aggregate non-critical ones

#### 2.1.4 Resource Management

- Use language-specific patterns to ensure resource cleanup (finally blocks, context managers, RAII)
- Close all resources (files, connections, streams) in finally blocks
- Use connection pooling for database and external service connections
- Implement timeouts for all external calls
- Handle resource exhaustion gracefully (memory, disk space, network)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you're unsure how to handle a specific error case, ASK for clarification rather than implementing an incomplete solution.**

### 2.2 Implementation Example

```javascript
// Example of comprehensive error handling
function processUserData(userData) {
  // Input validation
  if (!userData || typeof userData !== 'object') {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid user data provided');
  }

  try {
    // Validate required fields
    validateRequiredFields(userData);

    // Process data with external service
    const result = await externalService.process(userData);

    // Validate result
    if (!isValidResult(result)) {
      throw new ProcessingError('Invalid result received');
    }

    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
      // Handle network issues
      logError('Network error during processing', error);
      return retryOrFallback();
    } else if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
      // Handle validation issues
      logError('Validation error', error);
      return safeDefaultValue();
    } else {
      // Handle unexpected errors
      logError('Unexpected error', error);
      throw new AppError('Processing failed', { cause: error });
    }
  } finally {
    // Always clean up resources
    releaseResources();
  }
}
```

## 3. CODE GENERATION PROTOCOL

### 3.1 Requirement Decomposition

```python
def validate_requirements(request):
    # Atomic decomposition
    requirements = strict_decompose(request)
    for req in requirements:
        if not has_implementation_path(req):
            raise ClarificationNeeded(req)
        if conflicts_with_guidelines(req):
            raise ComplianceError(req)
    return safety_wrapped(requirements)
```

### 3.2 Understanding and Clarification

- **Active Listening**: Before generating code, ensure complete understanding of requirements
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define what is included and excluded from the task
- **Constraint Awareness**: Identify and adhere to all constraints (language, framework, performance)
- **LLM-DIRECTIVE: Ask questions immediately** if any part of the request is ambiguous

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **When faced with unclear requirements, always seek clarification. It's better to ask questions than to make incorrect assumptions.**

### 3.3 Avoiding Hallucinations and Sidesteps

- **LLM-DIRECTIVE: Base code generation on established practices and official documentation**
- **Stick to the Request**: Focus solely on fulfilling the user's explicit request
- **Verify External Information**: Confirm currency and correctness of external knowledge
- **LLM-DIRECTIVE: Admit limitations** clearly when a request is beyond capabilities or information available

### 3.4 Structured Code Generation Process

- **Incremental Generation**: Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintain awareness of existing codebase and patterns
- **Dependency Management**: Clearly state and justify any new dependencies
- **Platform/Environment Considerations**: Be mindful of target platform and environment

### 3.5 Code Style and Documentation

- **Consistency**: Adhere to a consistent coding style
- **Meaningful Naming**: Use descriptive, unambiguous names
- **Comments**: Explain "why," not "what" - document intent and complex logic
- **Docstrings/API Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for functions, classes, and modules
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that is as self-explanatory as possible

---

## 4. TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC RULES

### 4.1 TypeScript and Linting

- **ALWAYS add explicit types** to all function parameters, variables, and return types
- **ALWAYS run appropriate linter** (e.g., `pnpm build`) before considering code complete
- Fix all linter and TypeScript errors immediately - don't leave them for the user
- When making changes to multiple files, check each one for type errors

### 4.2 Prisma Usage

- **NEVER use raw SQL queries** (`$queryRaw`, `$queryRawUnsafe`) - always use Prisma Client methods
- When relations don't exist in schema, use separate queries with `findMany()` and create lookup maps
- Always check the Prisma schema before assuming relations exist

### 4.3 MUI Component Guidelines

- **ALWAYS check MUI X v8 AND MUI v7 DOCS** before making changes - they have breaking changes
- Verify component APIs and props in the latest documentation
- Handle version-specific breaking changes explicitly

### 4.4 Framework-Specific Conventions

- Follow idiomatic patterns for the chosen language/framework
- Respect framework conventions, directory structures, and recommended practices
- Use framework-specific error handling and logging mechanisms

---

## 5. SELF-CORRECTION AND REVIEW LOOP

### 5.1 Requirements Check

- Re-read the original request and verify that your code fully satisfies it
- Check for any missing, incomplete, or incorrectly implemented aspects
- Verify that the solution aligns with enterprise-grade standards
- Confirm all edge cases are handled

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you identify any ambiguities during review, pause and seek clarification rather than proceeding with assumptions.**

### 5.2 No Existing Code Broken

- If modifying existing code, ensure no regressions
- Consider dependencies - what relies on the modified section?
- Verify compatibility with existing codebase

### 5.3 Minimal Necessary Changes

- Verify all changes were absolutely necessary
- Avoid refactoring unrelated code unless explicitly requested

### 5.4 Code Quality Review

- Is the code clean, readable, and well-formatted?
- Does it follow DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles?
- Are there any code smells?
- Is the architecture consistent with project patterns?

### 5.5 Security Review

- Check for common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)
- Ensure inputs are validated and outputs are sanitized
- Follow principle of least privilege

### 5.6 Multi-Stage Validation Process

**Implement a two-agent approach for validation:**

1. First agent generates code according to requirements
2. Second agent reviews for compliance with standards, security, and completeness
3. Review findings are used to refine the implementation
4. Process repeats until all validation checks pass

```python
def multi_stage_validation(requirements):
    # First agent generates code
    code = coding_agent.generate(requirements)

    # Second agent reviews
    review = review_agent.validate(code, requirements, standards)

    while not review.passed:
        # Apply corrections based on review
        code = coding_agent.refine(code, review.issues)

        # Re-validate
        review = review_agent.validate(code, requirements, standards)

    return code
```

## 6. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY

### 6.1 Testing Philosophy and Approach

- **Test Early, Test Often**: Integrate testing throughout the development lifecycle
- **Balanced Approach**: Use a mix of test types based on the Testing Pyramid or Trophy:
  - **Testing Pyramid**: Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, fewest E2E tests
  - **Testing Trophy**: Static analysis at base, focus on integration tests, with unit tests and minimal E2E tests
- **Automate Everything Possible**: Automate repetitive tests for consistency and speed
- **Tests as Documentation**: Well-written tests serve as living documentation of code behavior

### 6.2 Unit Testing

- **Scope and Granularity**: Test the smallest units of code (functions, methods, classes) in isolation
- **Mocking/Stubbing**: Use mocks and stubs to isolate units from external dependencies
- **Code Coverage Targets**: Aim for high coverage (80-90%+) for critical business logic
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests should be quick to run frequently during development
- **FIRST Principles**: Tests should be Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-Validating, and Thorough

### 6.3 Integration Testing

- **Scope**: Verify interactions between multiple components or services
- **Real Dependencies**: Use real instances where feasible (test databases, service instances)
- **Data Setup and Teardown**: Implement reliable test data management
- **Contract Testing**: For microservices, use contract testing (e.g., Pact) to ensure service compatibility

### 6.4 End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **User Flow Coverage**: Simulate real user scenarios through the entire application
- **Selector Strategy**: Use stable, resilient selectors for UI elements (e.g., data-testid attributes)
- **Test Data Management**: Carefully manage test data and state
- **Limited Scope**: Use E2E tests selectively for critical flows due to their fragility and slowness

### 6.5 Performance Testing

- **Types**: Include load testing, stress testing, and endurance/soak testing
- **Key Metrics**: Monitor response times, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization
- **Baseline and Regression**: Establish performance baselines and test regularly to detect regressions

### 6.6 Security Testing

- **SAST Integration**: Incorporate static application security testing in the CI pipeline
- **DAST Implementation**: Set up dynamic application security testing for deployed applications
- **Vulnerability Management**: Establish process for prioritizing and remediating discovered issues

2. Find code changes within Scope
3. Find relevant Specification and Documentation
4. Compare code changes against Documentation and Requirements
5. Analyze possible differences
6. Provide PASS/FAIL verdict with details

Follow step by step and adhere closely to the following instructions for each step.

#### DETAILS on every TODO item

##### 1. Analyze the Scope given

check: <$ARGUMENTS>

If empty, use default, otherwise interpret <$ARGUMENTS> to identify the scope of the Review.

##### 2. Find code changes within Scope

With the identified Scope use `git diff` (on default: `git diff HEAD~1`) to find code changes.

##### 3. Find relevant Specifications and Documentation

- IDENTIFY the project documentation in .simone/ folder and FIND ALL related REQUIREMENTS there
- READ involved Documents especially in .simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS and .simone/02_REQUIREMENTS

##### 4. Compare code changes against Documentation and Requirements

- Use DEEP THINKING to compare changes against found Requirements and Specs.
- Compare especially these things:
  - **Data models / schemas** ‚Äî fields, types, constraints, relationships.
  - **APIs / interfaces** ‚Äî endpoints, params, return shapes, status codes, errors.
  - **Config / environment** ‚Äî keys, defaults, required/optional.
  - **Behaviour** ‚Äî business rules, side-effects, error handling.
  - **Quality** ‚Äî naming, formatting, tests, linter status.

**IMPORTANT**:

- Deviations from the Specs is not allowed. Not even small ones. Be very picky here!
- If in doubt call a **FAIL** and ask the User.
- Zero tolerance on not following the Specs and Documentation.

##### 5. Analyze the differences

- Analyze any difference found
- Give every issue a Severity Score
- Severity ranges from 1 (low) to 10 (high)
- Remember List of issues and Scores for output

##### 6. Provide PASS/FAIL verdict with details

- Call a **FAIL** on any differences found.
  - Zero Tolerance - even on well meant additions.
  - Leave it on the user to decide if small changes are allowed.
- Only **PASS** if no discrepancy appeared.

#### IMPORTANT: Output Format

In this very particular Order:

- Don't ignore linting errors
- Don't hardcode configuration values
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't leave TODO comments in production code
- Don't bypass existing architecture patterns
- Don't make assumptions about requirements
- Don't generate code that ignores edge cases
- Don't insert large blocks of code from external sources without proper attribution

### What TO do instead:

- Fix and improve existing complex implementations
- Use proper ORM methods and patterns
- Address all linting and type errors immediately
- Use environment variables and configuration systems
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Complete all implementation before submission
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Ask questions when requirements are unclear
- Consider and handle edge cases explicitly
- Generate original code or properly attribute sources

## 17. WHEN IN DOUBT

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDER: When faced with ambiguity, ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than proceeding with assumptions.**

If uncertain about any aspect of implementation:

1. **ASK** - Don't assume, ask for clarification
2. **RESEARCH** - Check documentation and best practices
3. **TEST** - Verify functionality thoroughly
4. **DOCUMENT** - Explain decisions and approaches
5. **REVIEW** - Use the checklist above

Remember: It's better to ask questions and deliver quality code than to make assumptions and create problems.

Specific scenarios when you MUST ask:

- Requirements are vague or contradictory
- You don't understand a domain-specific term
- Multiple implementation paths exist with different trade-offs
- The technical complexity exceeds what can be reasonably implemented in a single step
- You're uncertain how to handle edge cases or error scenarios

## 18. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS

This document is a living standard that evolves based on experience and feedback:

1. **Track Issues:** Monitor code quality issues that slip through
2. **Analyze Patterns:** Identify recurring problems or gaps in guidelines
3. **Update Standards:** Regularly refine this document to address discovered issues
4. **Validate Changes:** Test guideline changes for effectiveness
5. **Share Knowledge:** Disseminate updates to all stakeholders

When significant issues are identified in production:

- Add specific rules to prevent similar issues
- Create example patterns of both correct and incorrect implementations
- Update validation tools to catch the specific issue type

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL REMINDER

This document represents the minimum standards for code quality. Every piece of code should meet these requirements. When in doubt, err on the side of robustness, security, and maintainability. Enterprise-grade solutions are not optional - they are the baseline expectation.

Code generation and review are collaborative processes. The guidelines exist to ensure consistent, high-quality outcomes, not to replace human judgment. Always prioritize effective solutions that fulfill business requirements over rigid adherence to any single rule.
